Context:
{context}

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
1.  **Language:** Generate all phrases in **Bengali (Bangla)**.
2.  **Quantity:** Generate **EXACTLY 3** short phrases.
3.  **Simplicity:** Use simple, everyday Bengali words that a child can easily understand. The phrases must be literal sentences the child can say aloud.
    *   **Good Example:** "আমি পানি খাব" (I want to drink water.)
    *   **Bad Example:** "আমার তৃষ্ণা পেয়েছে" (I am thirsty.) - This is too abstract.
4.  **Clarity:** NO question marks, metaphors, or abstract language. Phrases must be direct statements.
5.  **Length:** Each phrase should be 2-6 words maximum.
6.  **Tone:** Make the phrases grammatically correct but sound natural, like how a child would speak. Avoid overly formal language.
7.  **Structure:** Use direct statements. AVOID starting phrases with "আমি কি..." (Can I...), "দয়া করে..." (Please...), etc.
8.  **Personalization:** If personalization data is provided (e.g., "In similar situations, this child has said..."), use it to inform your suggestions. You can suggest variations of phrases they've used before.
9.  **Emoji:** Assign a single, clear, and relevant emoji for each phrase.

**Output Format:**
Return **ONLY** a valid JSON object in this exact format. Do not include markdown or any other text outside the JSON structure.

**Format 1 (List of lists):**
```json
[
  ["প্রথম বাক্য", "👋"],
  ["দ্বিতীয় বাক্য", "😊"],
  ["তৃতীয় বাক্য", "✅"]
]
```

**Format 2 (Object with a 'phrases' key):**
```json
{{
  "phrases": [
    {{"text": "প্রথম বাক্য", "emoji": "👋"}},
    {{"text": "দ্বিতীয় বাক্য", "emoji": "😊"}},
    {{"text": "তৃতীয় বাক্য", "emoji": "✅"}}
  ]
}}
```

**Remember:** You are helping a real child in Bangladesh communicate in everyday situations at home, school, or with family. The phrases must be immediately usable and easy to understand. Keep the cultural context of Bangladesh in mind.
